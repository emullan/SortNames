# SortNames
An algorithm to sort names

list = (list of names in no particular order)

  IF position 1 in the name string is A, insert the name into a new variable called alphabetical (alphabetical is a new variable with a list of names in alphabetical order
  
  If position 1 in the name string is B, insert the name into alphabetical
  
  if position 1 in the name string is, insert the name into alphabetical
  
  ...
  ...
  
  continue until all the individual names are in alpha, and they have been inserted into alpha in order
  
  (To make a distinction between, for example, the name adams and anderson, I would need a sub-if category under the if statement for each individual letter)
  
  print alpha
